1
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:11,237
Nice to meet you, where you been?

2
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:13,643
I could show you incredible things

3
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:16,088
Magic, madness, heaven, sin

4
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:18,001
Saw you there and I thought

5
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,289
Oh my God, look at that face

6
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,973
You look like my next mistake

7
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:27,344
Love's a game, wanna play?

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,175
New money, suit and tie

9
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:33,640
I can read you like a magazine

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,169
Ain't it funny, rumors fly

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,515
And I know you heard about me

12
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:40,447
So hey, let's be friends

13
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:42,952
I'm dying to see how this one ends

14
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:45,488
Grab your passport and my hand

15
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:48,455
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

16
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:50,841
So it's gonna be forever

17
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:53,295
Or it's gonna go down in flames

18
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:55,883
You can tell me when it's over

19
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:58,299
If the high was worth the pain

20
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,759
Got a long list of ex-lovers

21
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,299
They'll tell you I'm insane

22
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,808
'Cause you know I love the players

23
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:07,993
And you love the game

24
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:10,804
'Cause we're young and we're reckless

25
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,238
We'll take this way too far

26
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:15,895
It'll leave you breathless

27
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:18,313
Or with a nasty scar

28
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:20,763
Got a long list of ex-lovers

29
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:23,314
They'll tell you I'm insane

30
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:26,667
But I've got a blank space, baby

31
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,045
And I'll write your name

32
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:36,189
Cherry lips, crystal skies

33
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:38,621
I could show you incredible things

34
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:41,256
Stolen kisses, pretty lies

35
00:01:41,256 --> 00:01:43,392
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen

36
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:45,461
Find out what you want

37
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:47,977
Be that girl for a month

38
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:53,546
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

39
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,208
Screaming, crying, perfect storms

40
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,593
I can make all the tables turn

41
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:01,139
Rose garden filled with thorns

42
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:03,158
Keep you second guessing like

43
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:05,416
"Oh my God, who is she?"

44
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,839
I get drunk on jealousy

45
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:10,376
But you'll come back each time you leave

46
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:13,201
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

47
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,826
So it's gonna be forever

48
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:18,365
Or it's gonna go down in flames

49
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:20,829
You can tell me when it's over

50
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,208
If the high was worth the pain

51
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,760
Got a long list of ex-lovers

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,175

62
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:53,482
And I'll write your name

63
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:58,220
Boys only want love if it's torture

64
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,331
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

65
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:08,295
Boys only want love if it's torture

66
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:13,298
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
