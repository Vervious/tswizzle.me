I Almost Do prod. by Nathan Chapman
[Verse 1]
I bet this time of night you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window, looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you that I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
That in my dreams you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I bet this time of night you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window, looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
