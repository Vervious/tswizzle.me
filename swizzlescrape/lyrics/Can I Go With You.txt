Can I Go With You
[Verse 1]
Any day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

[Verse 2]
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're going to be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

[Verse 3]
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't going to take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

[Verse 4]
Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

[Outro]
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
