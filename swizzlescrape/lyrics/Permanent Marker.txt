Permanent Marker
[Verse 1]
I know he loved you
A long time ago
I arenâ€™t jealous of you
Just thought you should know

You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
Cause I'm not trying to show maturity

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

[Verse 2]
I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is

[Chorus]
"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart

[Chorus]

[Outro]
In permanent marker

Oh, permanent marker
