Clean prod. by Imogen Heap
[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back-and-forth
You still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2]
There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

[Chorus]
