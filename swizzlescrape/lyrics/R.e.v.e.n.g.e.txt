[Verse-1]
I could have keyed your car
I could have rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your emails and everything you do
I could have put them to good use

But I'm dressed to kill
And tonight I am going out on a date
With your best friend
He always liked me anyway

My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery
Gon' give you what you gave to me

[Bridge]
Make you feel so B.A.D

I hope you cry, I'm getting my
R.E.V.E.N.G.E

[Verse-2]
So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory everywhere we've ever been
I don't hang-out at smokey bars, but I know we'll see you there
And I'll make you hear me laughing, like I just don't care

I know you hate my friends, so tonight I called them all
And later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby!

[Hook]

[Interlude]
S-A-N-I-T-Y
I hope you lose yours tonight
You've made me crazy too long
And so I'm working on

[Hook]

[Outro]

Oh, and give you what you gave to me
Oh
