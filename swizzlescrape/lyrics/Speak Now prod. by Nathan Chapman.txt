Speak Now prod. by Nathan Chapman
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel

And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door

Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said "speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march

And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't 'cha)

[Chorus x2]

Oh Oh Oh! ( said speak now)

I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me

Horrified looks from
Everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

( Ha! )

[Chorus]

And you say
"Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door"

Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
"Speak now"
