How You Get The Girl prod. by Max Martin & Shellback
[Intro]
Uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain (rain)
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
See it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl

[Pre-Chorus]
And then you say, I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever

[Chorus]
And that's how it works
And how you get the girl, girl (oh-ohhh)
And that's how it works
And how you get the girl, girl

[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be (be)
Yeah-yeah, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind
When you left her all alone and never told her why
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now you say...

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge]
And you know that I don't want you to go
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me
And then you say...

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]
