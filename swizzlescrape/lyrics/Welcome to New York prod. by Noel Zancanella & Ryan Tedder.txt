Welcome to New York prod. by Noel Zancanella & Ryan Tedder
[Verse 1]
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York!
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York!
It's been waiting for you

[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack
I can dance to this beat (beat)
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me (me)
Welcome to New York!
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

[Chorus + Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

[Chorus + Post-Chorus]
