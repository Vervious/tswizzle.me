High School by Smoke Money  (Ft. Kanye West) prod. by DJ Khaled
[Intro - Taylor Swift]
I can see us going far
You shine like a shooting star
I want to see you forever
Be with me forever

[Verse 1 - Smoke Money]
I just want to s**t it
I just wanna to hit it
I think I should kill it
I got no time for s**t
I just see the girl
She looks like a loner
I'll put her in my f**king life
Like a f**king boner
It is like I just got here
I drank way too much beer
I'm laughing at you f**ks
When your botch tries to suck
Me into her life
She can't be my wife
I have got a fiancee
What else should I say?

[Pre-Hook 1 - Smoke Money]
I ain't really sure how I made it to the west
But yeah, DJ Khaled, we are the best

[Pre-Hook 2 - Taylor Swift]
I want to sing to you right now
But you don't listen and I don't see how
I'll spend whole life trying to track
You even fron the front to the back

[Hook - Taylor Swift]
And I can see us going far
You shine like a shooting star
I want to see you forever
Be with me forever
Yeah, yeah
In High School
This would've caused trouble
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2 - Smoke Money]
I lost it for a second
That is what a reckon
That is what I think
Soon my ship might sink

[Pre-Hook 1]

[Pre-Hook 2]

[Hook]

[Bridge - Taylor Swift]
I wish we could live
For 200 years
My life is what I would give

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
I just think she saw me
I don't know what to be
Should I be getting scared?
Or would that be fair?
I just want that chick
To see that I'm not thicke
This ain 't my first try
But I might wanna say bye

For now...

[Hook]
