Haunted prod. by Nathan Chapman
[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I’d live to see it break

It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa holding my breath
Won't loose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus:]
C’mon c’mon don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
C’mon c’mon don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing it was you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know I know I just know
You're not gone you can't be gone no

[Chorus]

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I’d see it break
Never thought I’d see it
