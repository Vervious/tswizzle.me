Wonderland prod. by Max Martin & Shellback
[Verse 1]
Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
Cause nothing's as it seems and spinning out of control

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twistin' round me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found Wonderland you
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland

[Verse 2]
So we went on our way, too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there was strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile
Didn't it all feel new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting round me
Its all fun and games till somebody looses their mind

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]
I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad

[Chorus]
