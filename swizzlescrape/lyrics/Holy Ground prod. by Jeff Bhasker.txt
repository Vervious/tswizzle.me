Holy Ground prod. by Jeff Bhasker
[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Hook]
And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

[Hook]

[Bridge]
