I Know Places prod. by Noel Zancanella & Ryan Tedder
[Verse 1]
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign (bad sign)

Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame
It could burn out, it could burn out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

[Chorus]

[Outro]
They take their shots, we're bulletproof
(I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you
(I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
(I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me
(I know places)
