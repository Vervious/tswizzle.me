Teardrops on my Guitar prod. by Nathan Chapman
[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
But I want and I need and
Everything that we should be

I bet she's beautiful
That girl she talks about
And she's got everything that I've gotta live without!
Drew talks to me
I laugh because it's so damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night

[Hook]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song, in the car, I keep singing, Don't know why I do..

Drew walks by me, Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

[Hook]

[Bridge]
So I'll drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Hook]

[Outro]
He's the time, taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew walks, toward me
I fake a smile, so he won't see
