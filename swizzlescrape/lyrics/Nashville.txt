Nashville
[ Verse 1: ]
On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance

[ Chorus: ]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by

[ Verse 2: ]
You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

[Chorus]

[ Chorus 2: ]
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

[ Bridge: ]
And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

[ Outro: ]
Going back to Nashville
I'm going back to Nashville
Going back to Naaaaahh....
Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why?
