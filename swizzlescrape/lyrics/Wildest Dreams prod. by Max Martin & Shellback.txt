Wildest Dreams prod. by Max Martin & Shellback
[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha
Wildest dreams, ah-aah ha

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

[Chorus]

[Bridge] (x2)
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

[Chorus - Variation]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in pretend

[Chorus]
