Lucky You
[Verse 1]
There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you

[Verse 2]
She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you

[Verse 3]
Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you arenâ€™t so far away

[Chorus]
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you
