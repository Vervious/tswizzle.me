Two Is Better Than One by Boys Like Girls 
[Verse 1]
Remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought hey
You know, this could be something
Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you thought that it got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Verse 2]
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, hey (hey, hey)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I'm thinking, ooh, I can't live without you
Cause, baby, two is better than one
There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
But I'll figure out with all that's said and done
Two is better than one, two is better than one
