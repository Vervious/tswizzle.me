Invisible
[Verse 1]
She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She’ll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can’t see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

[Chorus]
I just want to show you
She don’t even know you
She's never going to love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Verse 2]
There’s a fire inside of you
That can’t help but shine through
She’s never going to see the light
No matter what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we’re invisible
I just want to open your eyes
And make you realize

[Chorus]
I just want to show you
She don’t even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

[Outro]
She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
