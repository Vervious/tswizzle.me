We Were Happy
[Verse 1]
We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were going to buy someday
And we were happy

[Verse 2]
We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sort of how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
Cause we were happy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
Cause we were happy

We Were Happy

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, We were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We Were happy
