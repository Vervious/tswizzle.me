Christmases When You Were Mine
[Verse 1]
Please take down the mistletoe
Because I don't want to think about that right now
Because everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you are well
Well I am doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

[Chorus]
I know this should not be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 2]
I have been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

[Chorus]
But for me it is just a lonely time
Because there were Christmases when you were mine

[Verse 3]
Merry Christmas everybody
That will have to be something I just say this year
I will bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

[Chorus]
I know this should not be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I did not wonder how you are tonight
Because there were Christmases when you were mine

[Outro]
You were mine
