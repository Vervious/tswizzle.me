Breathe prod. by Nathan Chapman
[Verse 1]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Because none of us thought it was
Going to end that way
People are people
And sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm, mm mm

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you
Don't really want to see
Because it's tragedy and it'll only bring you
Down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

[Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to
Save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't
Breathe
Without you but I have to breathe
Without you but I have to

[Verse 2]
Never wanted this, never want to see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people
And sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is going to save us from the fall out

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's 2 A.M
Feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy
Easy for me
It's 2 A.M
Feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this arenâ€™t easy
Easy for me

[Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Oh

[Chorus]
I can't breathe
Without you but I have to breathe
Without you but I have to breathe
Without you but I have to

[Outro]
Sorry, sorry
Sorry, (Yeah eh) sorry
Sorry, sorry
Sorry
