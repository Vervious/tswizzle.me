Blank Space Remix

Intro :[King Sesame]
Take this Red eye with a Jedi

I'll rather be on your best side
On your breast thighs
Lift up your lil skirt shotgun let's ride
I heard your ass was spoil
I've got something for you
I'm a king u be loyal and I'ma treat u royal
From the first that I saw u I knew your type
You're  a player maim but I'ma never loose this fight
Heartbreaker killing every dude in sight
But I'm Darth vader different from every other dude u wiped
Blank space
