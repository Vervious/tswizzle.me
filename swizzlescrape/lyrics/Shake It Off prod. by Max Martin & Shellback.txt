[Verse 1]
I stay out too late, got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, that's what people say
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
At least that's what people say, that's what people say

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I keep cruisin', can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind sayin' it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off,  I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 2]
I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don’t see, that's what they don’t see
I'm dancin' on my own, I'll make the moves up as I go
And that's what they don't know, that’s what they don’t know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I keep cruisin', can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music in my mind sayin' it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus] (x4)
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey, just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and dirty, dirty cheats of the world you could have been getting down to this sick beat

[Bridge]
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like “oh my God”, but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus] (x4)
