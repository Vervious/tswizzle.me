All You Had To Do Was Stay prod. by Max Martin & Shellback
[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

[Pre-Chorus]
(Stay) hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay) hey
Now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well could have been easy

[Chorus]
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was stay

[Verse 2]
Here you are now calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this, not like this

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]
