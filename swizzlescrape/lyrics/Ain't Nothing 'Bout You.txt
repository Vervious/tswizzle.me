Ain't Nothing 'Bout You
[Intro]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me

[Verse 1]
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me

Whoa

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you got to do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

[Chorus]

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive

[Outro]
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
