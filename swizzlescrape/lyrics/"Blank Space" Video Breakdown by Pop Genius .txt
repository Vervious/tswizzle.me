"Blank Space" Video Breakdown by Pop Genius 
In bed with the cat

The boyfriend sets his eyes on her

"Wanna play?" invitation

"I can read you like a magazine" across the dinner table

Riding bikes indoors

Ballroom dancing

Painting a portrait

Walking the dogs

Riding horses

Hanging his portrait on the blank wall space

Carving their names in the tree

"Young and reckless" chase

That sweetheart candy

"The worst is yet to come" plot twist

"Turn the tables"

Dropping his phone

Stabbing the picture

"They'll tell you I'm insane"

Ruining his clothes

Throwing his burning clothes from the balcony

The apple

Stabbing the bleeding heart cake

Wrecking his car

Chopping down the tree

Blank space
