Blank Space (Remix) by JXXIII  prod. by Max Martin & Shellback
[Verse 1]
Nice to see you, how you been
I could show you some wonderful things
Aladdin, Jasmine, level in'
I saw you there and I thought
Oh my God Its been this late
But I say fuck it man, this is fate
Coming full force and I'm in yo lane (aye)
A-T-L, New York, Dubai
So many places you haven't seen
I praise the Lord,cause damn I'm fly (damn)
And I know that you heard about me
But hey, fuck yo friends
They don't know how the story ends
Pack yo shit we going to Japan
Bring the drugs,I can bring pain
Like The Weeknd

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever (mmh)
Or it's gonna go down in flames
Just copped a Range Rover (mmh)
I ain't really fucking wit these lames
Got a long list of some haters
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I'm a fucking slayer
And you will get slayed!
Cause I'm young and I'm reckless (mmh)
And I'm a take it way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of some haters
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 2]

Cherry lips crystal skies
Damn yo hips between my thighs
Blanks space and chicken pies
Gossip columns filled with lies
But only we know
What's true, You found me
And I found you
T-Swizzy blessed the beat
And that's exactly what I'm a do
Break it down chop and screw
Roll it up for a few, Crushing since college
And now! you feel the same too
From concrete a rose grew
Rough diamonds sold to a diamond in the rough
With potential and soul too
Take it back to '02
When music was way real
You my muse, I ain't confused
Blank space lets chill
And kill
Time that was lost in the past
You hold my body, kiss my lips
Damn! even when it's chapped
You the Ad lib to my rap
You the quest to my map
Overflow & overlap
The chemistry interact
Gemini with Libra fever
Damn I got the Heebie Jeebie
Now I know it's true you need me
We make a beautiful collab' nigga!

[Chorus]

So it's gonna be forever (mmh)
Or it's gonna go down in flames
Just copped a Range Rover (mmh)
I ain't really fucking wit these lames
Got a long list of some haters
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I'm a fucking slayer
And you will get slayed!
Cause I'm young and I'm reckless (mmh)
And I'm a take it way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of some haters
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]

Boy come and take my love it ain't torture (nah)
Don't listen to them critics,they ain't for ya (x2)


[Chorus]

So it's gonna be forever (mmh)
Or it's gonna go down in flames
Just copped a Range Rover (mmh)
I ain't really fucking wit these lames
Got a long list of some haters
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I'm a fucking slayer
And you will get slayed!
Cause I'm young and I'm reckless (mmh)
And I'm a take it way too far
It'll leave you breathless (mmh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of some haters
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
