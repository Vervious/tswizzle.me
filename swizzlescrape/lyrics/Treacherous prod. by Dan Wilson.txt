Treacherous prod. by Dan Wilson
[Produced by Dan Wilson]

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye
To eye
Till the gravity's too much
And ill do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And i'd be smart to walk away
But you're quick sand

[Hook]
This slope is Treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is Treacherous
And I I I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
Forever going with the flow but you're friction

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home

[Hook]

[Bridge + Hook]
