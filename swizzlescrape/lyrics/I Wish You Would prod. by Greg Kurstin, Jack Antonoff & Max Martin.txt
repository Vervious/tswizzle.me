I Wish You Would prod. by Greg Kurstin, Jack Antonoff & Max Martin
[Verse 1]
It's 2 am, in your car
Windows down, past my street the memories start
You say it's in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2am, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We were crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
It'd makes you turn straight back around

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad any more
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

[Break]
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad, love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

[Verse 3]
2 am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

[Chorus] + [Chorus 2] + [Break]
