Smokey Black Nights
[Verse 1]
Let's watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

[Verse 2]
I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

[Verse 3]
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

[Verse 4]
Still thought
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleaming
As my eyes went wild
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

[Verse 5]
I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

[Verse 6]
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

[Verse 7]
I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you

[Verse 8]
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

[Verse 9]
So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
On the
Smokey black nights
