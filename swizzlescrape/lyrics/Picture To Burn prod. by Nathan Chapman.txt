Picture To Burn prod. by Nathan Chapman
[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!

By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And if you're missing me
You'd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn
