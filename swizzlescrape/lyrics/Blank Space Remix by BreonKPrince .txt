Blank Space Remix by BreonKPrince 
Blank Space Remix

VERSE 01: Taylor Swift
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, want to play?
New money, suit & tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

HOOK:
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

VERSE 02: BreonKPrince
Nice to meet you, too, where have you been?
You'll show me the incredible things?
Classic, sadness, light within
I heard you there and I thought
Oh my gosh, look at you
You look like my new head ache
Love's evil, spell it backwards?
Get ready for this disaster, it'll be
Crazy to me, all this money, your'll be bonnie
Ain't it funny, I'm clydee, talk oddly
And I know the stuff that you say about me
Let's be friends? We are at our odds and ends
Grab my heart, we'll be in the society of friends
I'm trying to see our love through these converging lens
Grab your heart, cause I'm bout to cleanse
I can make you fit in with today's best trends

HOOK:
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

VERSE 03: Taylor Swift
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you the incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King baby I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
“ Oh my God, who is she? “
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

HOOK:
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

VERSE 04: BreonKPrince
Beautiful smile, my nobel prize
I would love to show you my beautiful sky
Reminisce of the times we had ambitious
About me and you, I'll be your King
You can be my queen
I'll be that guy that you want
Wait a month and we will see
The screaming, crying, the perfect storm
Will make us be together as a team
I'll keep you guessing like
“ Oh my gosh, he's with me! “
But I swear to you that I will never leave
Cause you make our love so misconceived

HOOK:
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

BRIGDE: (2x)
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
