Ten Dollars And A Six Pack
[Verse 1]
You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country loving really something for three months and a half

Everybody said that you were bad news
But baby I was betting on you

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm going to have to listen to my mamma’s "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Verse 2]
I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes

Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

[Verse 3]
Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big old serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mamma’s "I told you so"
You aren’t never been through that
You aren’t worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You aren’t worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
