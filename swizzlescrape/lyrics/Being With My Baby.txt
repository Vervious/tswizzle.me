Being With My Baby
[Verse 1]
All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Verse 2]
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Bridge]
Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby
