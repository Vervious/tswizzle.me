White Christmas
[Verse 1]
I am dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I am dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 3]
I am dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Outro]
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
