You Are In Love prod. by Jack Antonoff & Max Martin
[Verse 1]
One look, dark room meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
Moonlight reflects the chain on your neck
He says "Look up" and your shoulders brush
No proof one touch, you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence, silence you
You feel it on the way home, way home you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You're in love
True love
You are in love

[Verse 2]
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
For once you let go of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much but it said enough
You kiss on side walks, you fight, and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says "You're my best friend."
And you knew what it was, he is in love

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]
And so it goes you two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I spent my whole life trying to put it into words

[Chorus x3]
