This Is Really Happening
[Verse 1]
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It’s like I’m melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Verse 2]
Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can’t take my eyes off you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh Baby, here we are

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
Oh, this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Tell me
You’ll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening

[Outro]
Tell me, oh
You’ll always need me
(need me, tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening
