I Knew You Were In Trouble
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me all alone

You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back

Without me
Without me
Without me

And he's long gone, when he's next to me

And I realize the blame is on me

Chorus
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble
Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why

You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning

Now I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me

Chorus
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble
Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble

And the saddest fear, comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeaaaa

Chorus
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew right there x2)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble
Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble
