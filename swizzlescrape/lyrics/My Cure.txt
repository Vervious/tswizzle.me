My Cure
[Verse 1]
I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

[Chorus]
If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

[Verse 2]
Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you

[Chorus]
And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

[Verse 3]
They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

[Chorus]
Becasue if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

[Outro]
I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever
