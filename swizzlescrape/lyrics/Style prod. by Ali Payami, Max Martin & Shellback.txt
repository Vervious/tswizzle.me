Style prod. by Ali Payami, Max Martin & Shellback
[Verse 1]
Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a  while since I have even heard from you
I should just tell you to leave
Cause I know exactly where it leads
But I watch us go round and round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl"
He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I."
I said "I've been there, too, a few times"

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Just take me home

[Shortened Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back everytime
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
