The Diary Of Me
[Verse 1]
I’m a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kind of girl
Hey yeah what’s the word on you
Lay low I’m a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little lamb upper mental
Sometimes I get temper mental

[Chorus]
But here I am an open book
Turn the page it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

[Verse 2]
I’m poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
I’m a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I don’t get up
I just get down yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It’s raining on Sunday
There’s nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You’re the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can’t stop thinking about you
I bet you’re thinking of me too

[Chorus]
Well here I am an open book
Turn the page it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page it’s all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
