White Horse prod. by Nathan Chapman
[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you

Holding on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known
I should have known

[Chorus]
I'm not a princess, this aren’t a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell

[Verse 2]
This aren’t Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This aren’t Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
Because I'm not your princess, this aren’t a fairytale
I'm going to find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now

And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late to catch me now
