I Wished On A Plane
[Verse 1]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

But like the trees we cut our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't given off rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought was a star
I guess what you wrote on a paper
Wasn't really from your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
And I thought was a star

[Verse 2]
Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believe you'd be there
When I jumped in
Is arenâ€™t your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you

[Chorus]

And I was too cloudy
It's not my fault I just couldn't see

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim
