I Heart ?
[Verse 1]
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into

And it was over-rated
But just look what I’ve created
I came out alive but I’m black and blue-ue

Before you ask me if I’m alright
Think about what I
Had to do-o, yeah

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I’ll bet, you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I've got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

[Verse 2]
I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right

But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home and cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And when you're home alone at night
You'll still wonder
Why you took everything I had, oh baby
I had a lot about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know
Someday you will

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the break-up
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planed

[Verse 4]
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I've got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

[Outro]
Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand
