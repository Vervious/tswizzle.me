Silent Night
[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Halleluiah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ our Saviour is born

[Verse 3]
Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

[Outro]
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

Christ the Saviour is born
