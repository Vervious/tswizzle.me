Nevermind
[Verse 1]
Look at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I want to know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

[Chorus]
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

[Verse 2]
All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All I really want to say is I need to be
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mind
