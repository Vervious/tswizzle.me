Stay Stay Stay prod. by Nathan Chapman
[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said okay let's talk
And I said

[Hook]
Stay stay stay I've been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad mad mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you I only dated self indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me my fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave it's been occuring to me
I would like to hang out with you for my whole life

[Verse 3]
Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay stay stay stay

[Hook x2]
