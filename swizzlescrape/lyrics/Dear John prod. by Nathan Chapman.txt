Dear John prod. by Nathan Chapman
[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won’t fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin’ which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin’ up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home, I should've known

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it’s me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it’s you and your sick need
To give love and take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said
'Run as fast as you can’

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don’t you think nineteen’s too young?
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so, I should've known

[Verse 3]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don’t look now
I’m shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

[Verse 4]
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you should’ve known

[Outro]
You should’ve known
Don’t you think I was too young
You should’ve known
