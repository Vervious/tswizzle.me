1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:07,288
I stay up too late

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,058
Got nothing in my brain

4
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:13,114
That's what people say

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,958
That's what people say

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,008
I go on too many dates

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,050
But I can't make them stay

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,900
At least that's what people say

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,855
That's what people say

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,255
But I keep cruising

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,105
Can't stop, won't stop moving

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,154
It's like I got this music

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,305
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,553
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play

15
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:47,708
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,763
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,957
Shake it off, Shake it off

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,553
Heart break is gonna break, break, break, break, break

19
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,703
And I think it's gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,853
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,057
Shake it off, Shake it off

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,900
I never miss a beat

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,058
I'm lighting up my feet

24
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,057
And that's what they don't see

25
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:16,281
That's what they don't see

26
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,005
I'm dancing on my own

27
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,817
I make the moves as I go

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,955
And that's what they don't know

29
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:28,080
That's what they don't know

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,105
But I keep cruising

31
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,158
Can't stop, won't stop moving

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,200
It's like I got this music

33
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,883
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright

34
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:44,561
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play

35
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:47,716
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

36
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:50,771

Shake it off, Shake it off

38
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:56,561
Heart break is gonna break, break, break, break, break

39
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,711
And I think it's gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

40
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,861
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
